### Python Learning Journey 🐍 ###
	
This is my collection of Python basics and concepts, organized to make learning and looking things up easier.

📚 What’s Inside

Here are my notes and code examples on Python basics, set up to help you learn one step at a time.

Topics Covered

1. Comments & Documentation: How to write code that's clear and easy to maintain
2. Coding Conventions (PEP 8): Python's style guidelines
3. Basic Data Types - int, float, str, bool, None
4. Math Operations - Arithmetic and compound operators
5. String Manipulation - Concatenation, repetition, and methods
6. Data Structures - Lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets
7. Accessing Collections: How to use indexing, slicing, and keys
8. Built-in Functions: Common functions in Python
9. String Methods: capitalize(), upper(), lower(), replace(), and more
10. List Methods: append(), extend(), remove(), pop()
11. Set Methods: add(), union(), intersection(), difference()
12. Dictionary Methods: update(), keys(), values(), items()

🎯 Purpose

This is a living document that:

* Tracks my Python learning progress
* Serves as a quick reference guide
* Contains practical examples with explanations
* Follows Python best practices

💡 Key Concepts

Mutable vs Immutable

* Mutable (can be changed): lists, dicts, sets
* Immutable (cannot be changed): strings, tuples, numbers

Indexing

* Python uses zero-based indexing (first item is index 0)
* Negative indices count from the end (-1 is the last item)

Methods vs Functions

* Functions: Called directly → len(my_list)
* Methods: Called on objects → my_list.append(5)

🚀 How to Use

If you're new to Python, try reading each section in order since they build on each other. If you want something specific, just use the section headers to find it quickly.

All code examples include:

* What the code does
* Expected outputs (in comments)
* Explanations of key concepts

📖 Learning Resources

I learn best by practicing and experimenting. You can try any example in a Python interpreter to see the results for yourself.

🔄 Updates

I update this document often as I learn new things and get a better handle on Python basics.

🎓 Future Learning Path

Right now, I'm going through “Getting Started With Python for Quant Finance” in my free time again. Whenever I feel rusty or want to avoid getting stuck in endless tutorials, I spend about 20 hours on this course every six months to refresh my skills. Here are some topics I plan to cover next:

Core Python Modules

* ✅ Module 1: Python Basics (Current focus)
  * Custom functions
  * Loops and control structures
  * Classes and objects

Advanced Topics (Coming Soon)

* Module 2: Python Quant Stack
  * pandas for data analysis
  * Series and DataFrames
  * Time series data handling
* Module 3: Algorithmic Trading Fundamentals
  * Trading strategies
  * Market inefficiencies
  * Building trading systems
* Module 4-10: Advanced Quant Finance
  * Backtesting strategies
  * VectorBT optimization
  * Alpha factor engineering
  * Risk and performance analysis
  * Automated trade execution with Interactive Brokers API

In this learning journey, I'm mixing Python basics with real-world examples from quantitative finance.
